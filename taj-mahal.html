                    <h2>The Monument of Love</h2>
                    <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is widely recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India" and is one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.</p>

                    <h3>History & Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653. It required the labor of 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex and is built on a square plinth. The entire structure is perfectly symmetrical, except for the tomb of Shah Jahan, which was added later and disrupts the perfect balance.</p>

                    <p>The Taj Mahal combines elements from Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles. The main dome is 35 meters high and is surrounded by four smaller domes. The intricate marble inlay work features semi-precious stones forming floral patterns and calligraphy.</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit the Taj Mahal is during the cooler months from October to March. The monument is open from sunrise to sunset, except on Fridays when it's closed for prayers. Many visitors prefer to visit at sunrise or sunset when the changing light creates magical effects on the white marble.</p>

                    <h3>UNESCO World Heritage Site</h3>
                    <p>In 1983, the Taj Mahal was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was described as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage." The site attracts 7-8 million visitors annually, with around 200,000 from overseas.</p>
