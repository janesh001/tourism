                    <h2>The Holiest Sikh Shrine</h2>
                    <p>The Golden Temple, officially known as Harmandir Sahib, is the most sacred Gurdwara of Sikhism. Located in Amritsar, Punjab, this stunning architectural marvel is covered in gold and surrounded by a holy water tank called Sarovar. The temple represents equality, with four doors opening to four directions, welcoming people from all walks of life.</p>

                    <h3>History & Significance</h3>
                    <p>The foundation of the Golden Temple was laid by Guru Arjan Dev Ji in 1581 and completed in 1604. The temple was later gold-plated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the 19th century. The temple houses the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism. What makes it unique is that it's built on a lower level, signifying humility, and has four entrances representing openness to all faiths.</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The Golden Temple is open 24/7 throughout the year. However, the best time to visit is from October to March when the weather is pleasant. Early morning (4-6 AM) and evening (7-9 PM) are the best times to witness the temple in its full glory. The temple looks absolutely stunning when illuminated at night.</p>
